-- Only a subset of the algorithms provided by cryptonite are supported

-- members of the HashAlgorithm typeclass), we need to wrap them up into
-- a single data type if we are to write generic hashing functions.  And
-- we want to do that to prevent the spread of knowing which algorithm
-- is in use throughout the code.
